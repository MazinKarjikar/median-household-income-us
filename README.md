# A Data Science/Machine Learning Project on Factors of Median Household Income in the US

This project was about using data science practices and machine learning methods on real world data from publicly accesible datasets. The data was collected from sources such as the FBI and the Census Bureau.

Provided is a Jupyter notebook tutorial explaining each step of the analysis. The python data science libraries used include `requests`, `beautifulsoup`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `seaborn`, and `statsmodels`.

Also, the website linked to this repository is a great visual for the entire analysis!
